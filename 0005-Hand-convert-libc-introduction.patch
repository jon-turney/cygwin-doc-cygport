+    <para>
+      This reference manual describes the functions provided by the Red Hat
+      <quote>newlib</quote> version of the standard ANSI C library.  This
+      document is not intended as an overview or a tutorial for the C library.
+      Each library function is listed with a synopsis of its use, a brief
+      description, return values (including error handling), and portability
+      issues.
+    </para>
+    <para>
+      Some of the library functions depend on support from the underlying
+      operating system and may not be available on every platform.  For embedded
+      systems in particular, many of these underlying operating system services
+      may not be available or may not be fully functional.  The specific
+      operating system subroutines required for a particular library function
+      are listed in the <quote>Portability</quote> section of the function
+      description.  See <xref linkend="syscalls"/>, for a description of the
+      relevant operating system calls.
